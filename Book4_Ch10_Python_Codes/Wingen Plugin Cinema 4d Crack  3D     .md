Wingen is a plugin for Cinema 4D that allows you to create procedural geometry based on mathematical formulas. You can use it to generate abstract shapes, organic forms, fractals, and more. Wingen plugin is compatible with Cinema 4D R20 and above, and you can download it from [here](https://erensorpiboss.wixsite.com/delestsparun/post/wingen-plugin-cinema-4d-key-pc-full-nulled-exe-professional). However, be aware that this is an illegal cracked version of the plugin, and you may face legal consequences if you use it. The original developer of Wingen plugin is [Signal](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/14-essential-cinema-4d-plugins), and you can purchase it for $129 from their website.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Wingen plugin for Cinema 4D to create some interesting effects. We will cover the basic parameters of the plugin, as well as some tips and tricks to get the most out of it.

## Step 1: Add Wingen object
 
To start using Wingen plugin, you need to add a Wingen object to your scene. You can find it under Plugins > Wingen > Wingen Object. A Wingen object is a generator that creates geometry based on a formula. You can see the formula in the Attribute Manager, under the Formula tab. By default, the formula is set to "sin(x)\*cos(y)\*z", which generates a wavy surface.
 
## Step 2: Adjust the formula
 
You can modify the formula to create different shapes. The formula uses three variables: x, y, and z, which represent the coordinates of each point on the surface. You can use any mathematical functions and operators that are supported by Cinema 4D's XPresso system, such as sin, cos, tan, exp, log, pow, sqrt, abs, min, max, etc. You can also use constants such as pi and e. For example, if you change the formula to "sin(x\*y)\*z", you will get a more complex surface with ripples.
 
## Step 3: Adjust the size and resolution
 
You can also adjust the size and resolution of the Wingen object under the Object tab. The size parameters control the dimensions of the bounding box of the surface. The resolution parameters control the number of subdivisions of the surface. Increasing the resolution will make the surface smoother and more detailed, but also more computationally intensive. You can also enable or disable adaptive resolution, which automatically adjusts the resolution based on the camera distance.
 
## Step 4: Add modifiers
 
One of the most powerful features of Wingen plugin is that you can add modifiers to your Wingen object. Modifiers are additional formulas that modify the original formula in some way. You can find them under Plugins > Wingen > Modifiers. There are several types of modifiers available, such as noise, twist, bend, taper, deformers, etc. To add a modifier to your Wingen object, simply drag and drop it onto it in the Object Manager. You can then adjust its parameters in the Attribute Manager.
 
For example, if you add a noise modifier to your Wingen object, you will get a more organic and random look. You can change the type of noise, its amplitude, frequency, octaves, seed, etc. You can also animate the noise by changing its phase over time.
 
## Step 5: Add materials and lights
 
Once you are happy with your Wingen object and its modifiers, you can add materials and lights to your scene to make it more realistic and appealing. You can use any materials and lights that are compatible with Cinema 4D's standard or physical render engines. You can also use third-party render engines such as Octane or Redshift if you have them installed.
