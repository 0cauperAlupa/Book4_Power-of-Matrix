## 3D LUT Creator Pro Tutorial Examples
 
To help you get started with 3D LUT Creator Pro, we have selected some tutorial examples that show you how to use the software for different purposes.

### Color Match with the Reference Image
 
One of the most useful features of 3D LUT Creator Pro is the Color Match tool, which allows you to copy the toning and color scheme from one image to another. This can be very helpful if you want to match the colors of different images or create a consistent look for your project. To use the Color Match tool, you need to open two images in 3D LUT Creator Pro: one as the source image and one as the reference image. Then, you need to select the Color Match tool and click on the reference image. You will see a grid that shows the color distribution of both images. You can adjust the grid by dragging it or using the sliders to fine-tune the color matching. You can also use masks and channels to isolate specific areas of the image. Once you are satisfied with the result, you can save your 3D LUT and apply it to your source image or other images.
 
### How to Create 3D LUT Files from Lightroom Presets or Photoshop Plugins
 
If you have some Lightroom presets or Photoshop plugins that you like and want to use them in other programs, you can use 3D LUT Creator Pro to convert them into 3D LUT files. To do this, you need to open an image in Lightroom or Photoshop and apply your preset or plugin. Then, you need to export your image as a TIFF file with no compression. Next, you need to open 3D LUT Creator Pro and load your TIFF file as well as a neutral image that has no color adjustments. You can download a neutral image from [here](https://3dlutcreator.com/neutral.png). Then, you need to select the Color Match tool and click on the neutral image. You will see a grid that shows the color transformation of your preset or plugin. You can then save your 3D LUT as a file in various formats such as .cube, .3dl, .mga, etc. You can then import your 3D LUT into other programs and use it as a color adjustment.
 
### Skin Tone Color Correction by Numbers with RGB Curves
 
Another useful feature of 3D LUT Creator Pro is the RGB Curves tool, which allows you to adjust the red, green, and blue channels of your image separately. This can be very helpful if you want to correct the skin tone of your subject by using numerical values. To use the RGB Curves tool, you need to open an image in 3D LUT Creator Pro and select a skin area with the eyedropper tool. You will see the RGB values of that area in the bottom left corner of the screen. You can also see a histogram that shows the distribution of colors in your image. Then, you need to adjust the RGB curves by dragging them or using the sliders to match the desired skin tone values. You can find some recommended skin tone values for different ethnicities on [this site](https://www.wikihow.com/Correct-Skin-Tones-Using-Photoshop). Once you are satisfied with the result, you can save your 3D LUT and apply it to your image or other images.
