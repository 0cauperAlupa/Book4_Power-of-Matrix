Bad Biology is not a film for everyone. It is a film that deliberately pushes the boundaries of taste and decency, and revels in its own outrageousness. It is a film that mixes horror, comedy, and social commentary in a way that only Frank Henenlotter can. It is a film that has been praised by some critics as a "twisted masterpiece" and a "return to form" for Henenlotter[^4^], and panned by others as a "sickening waste of time" and a "childish sex comedy"[^2^].
 
One of the most interesting aspects of Bad Biology is the involvement of rapper R.A. the Rugged Man as the producer and co-writer. R.A. is a longtime fan of Henenlotter's films, and he approached him with the idea of making a movie together. R.A. also contributed to the soundtrack, along with other hip-hop artists like Prince Paul, Kool G Rap, and Smoothe Da Hustler. R.A. also appears in the film as one of Jennifer's ex-boyfriends, who gets his penis bitten off by her during sex.
